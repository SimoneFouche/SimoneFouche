- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @SimoneFouche
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in genome evolution specifically intragenomic conflicts, genomic oddities, B chromosomes (accessory chromosomes), transposable elements, selfish elements etc. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python and pretty much everything I am doing is new to be at the moment (avian genomics, nanopore and Hi-C data).
